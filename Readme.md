Groho (গ্রহ) is a simulator for inter-planetary travel and warfare.

The program aims to give the user intuitions about how inter-planetary travel, commerce and conflict would play out in the near future within the solar system. There is no faster than light travel, no hibernation (stasis) and there have only been technological advances in engineering, computing and biology. There have been no major practical breakthroughs in basic physics.

The program focuses on fidelity to physical simulation and on making it easy to setup, run and save simulations. Results of simulations are primarily available as event logs and state checkpoints. Detailed visualizations and ersatz interpolations between events are easy to compute and display, making it possible to set up as colorful a front end display as one wants.

Groho (গ্রহ) is the Bengali word for planet. Grohomondol (গ্রহমণ্ডল) is the word for planetary system but is more of a mouthful.
