Learning goals
==============
In no particular order or detail...

C++
---
Refamiliarize myself with writing big projects in C++, familiarize myself with the newer aspects of C++14


Machine learning
----------------
This is ill-defined but involves picking up techniques that will let me train an AI via self-exploration (as opposed to the classical supervised or unsupervised learning given static data). This will be more robotic learning, where the agent acts, the acts have consequnces in the physical world and the agent learns the consequences of these acts.


Numerical integration
---------------------
Refamiliarize myself with numerical methods and considerations of numerical stability.



Physics: Orbital physics and relativity
---------------------------------------
Relativity will be interesting to learn and will be fun to gradually add in relativistic effects.
