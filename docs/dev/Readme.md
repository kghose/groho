# Docs for Devs Contents

This contains miscellaneous documents related to development.
Notably the adaptive display IPython notebook is here because of historical
reasons and because this is where it is linked to from the blog. You should
not need to look into this directory manually ...

I originally wanted to put all development related documents here, but then I 
decided to simplify and have documents in three places

* Introduction, tutorial and miscellaneous in the main [readme](../../Readme.md)
* Input file tutorial/manual via [examples](../../examples)
* Development notes in the source code [readme](../../src/Readme.md)
