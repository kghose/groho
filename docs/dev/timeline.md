Objectives
----------
* Check overall design without spending any time on gravitational model and
  config parsing.
* Figure out sim file format and size tradeoffs
* Check if feasible to save just checkpoints and interpolate them when viewing
* OpenGL (or other)
  - Learn/execute plotting
  - Learn/execute interactions
* Figure out interactive design issues
