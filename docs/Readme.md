Documentation for me, users and developers
==========================================

User documentation
------------------

* [Tutorial][tut] - I also use the tutorial to constrain the scope of the
  program, plan out the interface for the code, and to determine what kind of 
  results I expect and in what form.
* [FlightPlan file format][fp]


[tut]: tutorial.md
[fp]: flight-plan.md


Developer documentation
-----------------------
Developer documentation is found one level down. 
Please see the [readme](dev/Readme.md) there
