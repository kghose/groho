Simulation file specifications
=============================

Ideally we would like to be able to add and remove objects from the simulation at any time. We would like to be able to efficiently track a given object even for long simulations with many objects. We would like to be able to fork a simulation file efficiently (start a new branch of the simulation from a stop point) and keep track of all the forks.
