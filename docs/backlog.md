================

v 0.0.0
-------
- Approximate position formulae (from E M Standish)
	- How to handle Earth-Moon orbits given Barycenter?
- Orrery model should be pluggable (so we can swap in model for v1.0.0 easily)
- Visualization code should be functionally 


- All bodies are spherical for collision detection
- Scripted actions
- Think about visualization


Learning for
