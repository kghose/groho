Backlog
=======
(Just an unprioritized list of ideas and things to work on)

* Refactor body objects to unify metadata scheme
* Introduce space craft into the simulation
* Figure out way to combine flight plan actions with spacecraft
* Display buffer data should include time so that we can scroll to or limit display by time
* Work on UI specifications (this is possibly in an older commit)


Version planning
================

v 0.0.0
-------
- Approximate position formulae (from E M Standish)
	- How to handle Earth-Moon orbits given Barycenter?
- Orrery model should be pluggable (so we can swap in model for v1.0.0 easily)
- Visualization code should be functionally 


- All bodies are spherical for collision detection
- Scripted actions
- Think about visualization


Learning for
- Numerical Integration
- Scripted actions
- Simulation save files
- Visualization
