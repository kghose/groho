; This scenario file sets up an orrery containing the 9 planets and
; dwarf planets and the moons of mars and incorporates two flight plans

; Some notes on scenario file syntax:

; Anything from a semi-colon onward is ignored
    ; Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed
    ; Empty lines are ignored

name  = Earth to Mars
begin = 2458248.5 ; This is in Julian Date
end   = 2458348.5 ; A 100 day simulation
step  = 60 ; This is in seconds
           ; The finer the step the more accurate the simulation
           ; but the longer it takes to run

; Both orrery and flightplan can have multiple entries

; Orrery refers to a NASA/JPL SPK file storing ephemeris data

; You can have multiple orrery files like this:
orrery = de430.bsp
orrery = mar097.bsp


; You can have multiple flightplans like this:
flightplan = durga.txt
flightplan = kali.txt
