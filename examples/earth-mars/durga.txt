; This is followed by a plan section which is a list of actions. 
; Each action has a time stamp followed by the name of the action and any
; arguments it takes. Like so

; <timestamp> <action name> <argument1> <argument2> ...

; The timestamp is the julian date

; An action will only happen after it's listed time. Actions happen 
; sequentially as they appear in the file. 
; It is illegal to have out of order time stamps in a flight plan.
