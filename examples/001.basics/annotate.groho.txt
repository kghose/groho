; The annotation script helps add live marks to the orbit diagram to show us
; properties of the simulation objects

; Annotations consist of an annotation name followed by parameters


show id:-1000 p:speed p:name p:fuel
; show puts a caret on the body in question and text with the properties asked for
;
; valid values for properties (p:) are
; name, speed, acc, fuel

show id:-1000 at:2458348.5 p:fuel
; By default the annotation travels with the time cursor. Adding an 
; at: <time> parameter restricts the annotation to the given time

show id:-1000 at:max-speed p:speed
; Instead of a <time> you can write max- or min- followed by a parameter
; and the annotation will appear only at the local max or min
; valid values for max-/min- are speed, acc

show-diff id:-1000 id:-1001 at:2458348.5 p:dist p:speed p:acc
; show-diff puts a line between the pair of ids and text with the differential
; of the properties asked for
;
; The other rules for show-diff are the same as for show
