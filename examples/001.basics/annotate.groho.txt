; The annotation script helps add live marks to the orbit diagram to show us
; properties of the simulation objects

; Annotations consist of an annotation name followed by parameters

mark id:all with:everything at:current-time
; This is a short cut that puts carets on every object in the simulation
; and shows all available object data and metadata tracking the current time
; of the simulation

mark id:-1001 at:current-time
; This marks just object -1000 (if it exists) and only with a caret at the
; current time. This is over-shadowed by our previous directive. What we may
; have wanted to do was ...

hide id:-1001
mark id:-1001 at:current-time
; This removes the marker for -1000 (if it exists, leaving all the others)
; And then adds a mark for just object -1000 (if it exists) and only with a 
; caret at the current time. 

; Of course, if we did not have mark id:all at the start, we would not need the
; hide commands.

mark id:-1002 with:speed at:2458348.5
; This creates a mark for this object at this particular time

mark id:-1002 with:speed at:max-acc
; This creates a mark for this object at this particular condition

; Valid values for the with: parameter can be obtained by doing something like
mark help
; This just causes this command to error and display a list of valid parameters


mark-pair srcid:499 dstid:-1001 with:all
; mark-pair has a similar syntax to mark and is used to mark the difference
; in state between the two objects.
