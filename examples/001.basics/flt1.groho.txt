; Spaceship commands are placed in a separate script file (called a "flight plan") 
; and a reference is put in the scenario file. 

; Like the scenario file, each line takes the form of a <key> <value> pair 
; The key is separated from value by whitespace. 
; While keys (which have reserved meanings) can not have spaces
; values can have spaces

; There are a few non-numeric keys for flight plans that set up
; spaceship metadata and initial state

initially orbiting 399 100x100
; This sets the ship up in an 100x100km orbit around the earth

; The remaining lines are plan actions.
; Each line starts with a activation time specified as a Gregorian date 
; followed by a plan action.
; A given plan will start no sooner than the activation time and will block
; until finished.
; The plans are sorted by activation time when they are loaded. If two plans
; have the same activation time their order of activation is undefined.

2050.01.01:0.5 orbit 200x200
; This plan raises the orbit to 200x200 leaving the orbital plane unchanged
; This is a two stage maneuver: One part of the orbit is modified and then
; half an orbit later, the next part is modified.
