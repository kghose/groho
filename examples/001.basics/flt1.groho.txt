; Spaceship commands are placed in a separate script file (called a "flight plan") 
; and a reference is put in the scenario file. 
; A line can contain a key = value pair (like the configuration file)
; and this indicates some property that will be set for the ship

; like metadata ...

name   = Durga
color  = 0x0000ff

; or characteristics ... 

max-acceleration  = 0.1   ; km/s^2 (a)
max-fuel          = 100   ; arbitrary units (u)
fuel-cons-rate    = 0.1   ; u / s / a 

; Or a line can take the form

; <time> <action> <key>:<value> <key>:<value> ...

; This is an action line. 
; It indicates the time an action is active from, the action and parameters
; Action lines form the bulk of a flight plan

- initial-orbit id:499 alt:3000 ; Orbit 499 (Mars) at 3000 km altitude
; An action with "-" is an initialization action that sets some initial state
; at the very start of the simulation.
; Some actions (like this one) are only available as initialization actions


; You can break a command across multiple lines for readability
- initial-orbit \ ; and add comments
    id:499 \ ; This is Mars
    alt:3000 ; This is km from the surface

; You'll notice that in order to show off my fancy multi-line command I 
; repeated the command. In this case the second one over-writes the first one
