; Spaceship commands are placed in a separate script file (called a "flight plan") 
; and a reference is put in the scenario file. 
; A line can contain a key = value pair (like the configuration file)
; and this indicates some property that will be set for the ship

; like metadata ...

name   = Ma Durga
color  = 0x0000ff

; or characteristics ... 

max-acceleration  = 0.1   ; km/s^2 (a)
max-fuel          = 100   ; arbitrary units (u)
fuel-cons-rate    = 0.1   ; There is no such key. groho will warn and move on 
burn-rate         = 0.1   ; u/s/a
burn-rate         = 0.2   ; This is a duplicate key. This value is used

; Or a line can take the form

; <action> <key>:<value> <key>:<value> ...

; This is an action line.
;
; Actions can be
; - commands for a ship to orient or fire it's engines
; - a waiting state that holds up execution until a particular ship state is achieved
; - commands to send out signals
;
; Action lines form the bulk of a flight plan

initial-orbit id:499 alt:3000 ; Orbit 499 (Mars) at 3000 km altitude
; Some actions (like this one) operate at the setup phase. It is best to put
; them at the start of the script: they will have the same effect wherever they
; are put, but it can be confusing to see them later

; You can break a command across multiple lines for readability
initial-orbit \ ; and add comments
    id:499 \ ; This is Mars
    alt:8000 ; This is km from the surface

; You'll notice that in order to show off my fancy multi-line command I 
; repeated the command. In this case the second one over-writes the first one

hi-there
; An un-recognized action is marked out in the log and ignored

; After a while in orbit, we get bored and blast off into the unknown

wait-till jd:2458167.1
; This waiting state just pauses until the given time passes

wait-till-phase id:499 phase:180
; This waits until we are on the "inner side" of Mars, nearest to the sun
; during our orbit.
