; Spaceship commands are placed in a separate script file (called a "flight plan") 
; and a reference is put in the scenario file. 
; A line can contain a key = value pair (like the configuration file)
; and this indicates some property that will be set for the ship

; like metadata ...

burn-rate         = 0.1   ; u/s/a
burn-rate         = 0.2   ; This is a duplicate key. This value is used

; Or a line can take the form

; <time> <action> <key>:<value> <key>:<value> ...

; This is an action line. 
; It indicates the time an action is active from, the action and parameters
; Action lines form the bulk of a flight plan
