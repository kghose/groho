; A scenario file tells Groho 
; - what Orrery model to use 
;   The Orrery is the thing that simulates the solar system 
; - what range of dates to run the simulation for and 
; - what flight plan files to include in the simulation. 
;   Flight plans are the biggest part of the simulation. 
;   Each spaceship has it's own flight plan which governs what it 
;   does in the simulation.

; This scenario file sets up an orrery containing the Earth and moon, and
; Mars and it's moons. It adds one spaceship

; Some notes on scenario file syntax:

; Anything from a semi-colon onward is ignored
    ; Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed
    ; Empty lines are ignored

name  = Earth to Mars
begin = 2458248.5 ; This is in Julian Date
end   = 2458948.5 ; A 100 day simulation
step  = 60 ; This is in seconds
           ; The finer the step the more accurate the simulation
           ; but the longer it takes to run

; Both orrery and flightplan can have multiple entries

; Orrery refers to a NASA/JPL SPK file (called a "kernel") that 
; stores ephemeris data

; You can have multiple orrery files like this:
orrery = ../de430.bsp   ; Sun, Earth + Moon, Barycenters for all planets
orrery = ../mar097.bsp  ; Mars + moons


; You can have multiple flightplans like this:
flightplan = flt1.groho.txt
flightplan = flt2.groho.txt
flightplan = flt1.groho.txt ; a repeated flight plan is ignored
