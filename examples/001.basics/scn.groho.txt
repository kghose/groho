; A scenario file tells Groho 
; - what Orrery model to use 
;   The Orrery is the thing that simulates the solar system 
; - what range of dates to run the simulation for and 
; - what flight plan files to include in the simulation. 
;   Flight plans are the biggest part of the simulation. 
;   Each spaceship has its own flight plan which governs what it 
;   does in the simulation.
