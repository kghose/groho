; A scenario file tells Groho 
; - what Orrery model to use 
;   The Orrery is the thing that simulates the solar system 
; - what range of dates to run the simulation for and 
; - what flight plan files to include in the simulation. 
;   Flight plans are the biggest part of the simulation. 
;   Each spaceship has its own flight plan which governs what it 
;   does in the simulation.

; This scenario file sets up an orrery containing the Earth and moon, and
; Mars and it's moons. It adds one spaceship

; Some notes on scenario file syntax:

; Anything from a semi-colon onward is ignored
    ; Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed
    ; Empty lines are ignored

name   Earth to Mars
begin  2050.01.15:0.5 ; YYYY.MM.DD:H  H is a fraction of a day  
end    2060.01.15:0 ; 
; sim-groho's job is to compute an appropriate time step for the simulation

begin  20500115  ; a malformed date will be skipped


; Both orrery and flightplan can have multiple entries

; Orrery refers to a NASA/JPL SPK file (called a "kernel") that 
; stores ephemeris data

; You can have multiple orrery files like this:
orrery   ../de430.bsp   ; Sun, Earth + Moon, Barycenters for all planets
orrery   ../mar097.bsp  ; Mars + moons
;orrery   ../ast343de430.bsp
; If a body is repeated across two or more files only the last instance will be taken

; You can mark out only some bodies for inclusion in the simulation
use-only 10 AG 399 ; only include SSB and Earth. AG is an error and will be flagged


; You can have multiple flightplans like this:
ship  flightplan/plan1.groho.txt
ship  flt2.groho.txt
ship  flt2.groho.txt ; a repeated flight plan is ignored

; An unexpected key will flag an error and be ignored
this key does not exist
